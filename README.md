## NewUpdateFixes
I fixed some of the terrible changes Northwood made in the 13.5 update.

- Cola has pre 13.5 movement speeds
- Cola has pre 13.5 health drain
- SCP-500 can cure the Traumatized effect caused by SCP-106

Each of these features is configurable, allowing them to be enabled or disabled as desired.

### Updated Values:
